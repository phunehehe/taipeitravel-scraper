taipeitravel-scraper
====================

`generate-map` is a script that scrapes the site http://www.taipeitravel.net/ and creates a map with a pin for each point of interest. The main purpose is to get an overview of the distance between those locations.

As it is, the map shows the locations of hiking trails in Taipei. It should be trivial to adapt the script to map other things (museums, temples, libraries etc.).

If you use this, please remember that after all, it's a scraper. Be nice to the site owner. The script doesn't generate much trafic, so it shouldn't be a problem. There is also a one second delay for each URL, which should lighten the load even further.
